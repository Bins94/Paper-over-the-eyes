# Complexity
emergence: the action of the whole is more than the sum of the actions of the parts.

complicated vs. complex
Watch is a complicated train of gears and springs.
Time-keeper is a kind of emergent property of a watch.
Complex system is for understanding. Focus on the inyeraction of emergent properites at various levels.

The behaviours of complex syetems
1. self-organization into patterns.
2. Chaotic behaviour: small changes in initical conditions produce large later changes.
3. fat-tailed behaviour, rare events occur more often than would be predicted by a normal distribution.
4. adaptive interaction
Emergent behaviour is an essential requirement for calling a system 'complex'.

CPS & CAS
CPS: complex physical systems
Focuse on geometric arrays of elements, interactions depend only on effects propagated from nearest neighbours. For example, cellular automaton.
Universal law: State of every square depend on the state of adjacent squares. Interaction between them follow the universal law.
Life: reproduce itself, CA
Butterfly effect
Self-organized criticality: The effect on a conical sandpile of a narrow steam of sand. Critical stage: sand to the bottom of the pile.
self-similarity:
snowflake curves and fractals


CAS: complex adaptive systems
The elements are adaptive agents.
