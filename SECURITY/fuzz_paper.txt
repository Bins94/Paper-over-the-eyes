## DeepState fuzz
https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/01/22/fuzzing-an-api-with-deepstate-part-1/
1. multiple main/test, a tree a fixed sequence. Run multiple test.
2. longer call sequence( libfuzz/afl limit?)
3. rand() --> deepstate_type() ( syzkaller hardcode in syscall script)
4. OneOf choose calls to execute
https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/01/23/fuzzing-an-api-with-deepstate-part-2/
1. language base mutate, universalmutator.

## What afl fuzz bad at
https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1238
Recognize special behavier as crash
Guid fuzz reach these behavier

## https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09362.pdf
Symexec (KLEE):targeted search strategy, shortest path search algorithm
Solution:
1. Fuzzer as a initial exploration, targeted symbolic execution explore uncovered function.
2. Symbolic execution for generating test case, fuzz them.
Contribution:
1. target search functionality in KLEE.
2. initial explore without state search, devote more time to harder-to-reach function.
3. high coverage.
Trade off the cost of integrity(SMT solve) and randomness(blind fuzz).
FS mode: fuzz for a limited amount of time, sonar-search as path-search strategy. Handwri\
te test case could be better.
SF mode: symbolic execution generate test case, use them as seed input, fuzz them.
Fuzz:AFL
Symexec:KLEE, explore call-graph, when a state was detected, explore the consecutive stat\
e. Drop those out of call-graph.
Orchestrator: 1. call-graph info of progrom. 2. function node with regular argument.
Individual target(directed) fuzz
Fuzz miss bug in "lesser called" functions of a program. Symexec miss bug in deeper funct\
ion of a program.
evaluate:
1. function coverage
2. coverage depth

## https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02981
KLEE generate seed input with a fixed target( bug)
Execute with the input, check if call stack is the same as call stack information of bug.\
 If not, the bug can't be reproduce. If yes, the path constrain is satisfied( symbolic ar\
gument). Just fuzz it.

## VUzzer: Application-aware Evolutionary Fuzzing(ndss 17)
Diffculty:
Magic byte: specify offset with specify value.
Deeper execution: right combination of input offset bytes.
Markers: markers may not prsent at a certain fields.
Nested conditions:
Vuzzer feature:
Data-flow: taint analysis to infer the struct of input. Instrument cmp instruction to determin the offset of input byte used by comparision and its expect value. Magic byte solution replace expensive symbolic excution.
Control-flow: Detect error-handling help mutating interesting byte. Assign weight basic block base on depth. error-handling have negative weight.
Static analyzer: get immediate values of comparision.
Fuzz loop: dynamic taint analysis. Generate initial input to get the magic-byte and error-handling. DTA has high overhead, use it sparingly after loop start.
Fitness calculation: weight basic block.
Genetic operators:
Detailing: 
DTA: trace the taint input offset used by comparision.
     magic-byte.
     weight of basic: build CFG, calculate how many time the basic block will be executed.
     Block(randominput) - Block(seedinput) = Block(errhandling)
Fitness: base on calculiation of basic block weight.

## moonshine: base on syzkaller


## Data flow sensitive fuzzing
https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20spring_gan_prepub.pdf
FTI(fuzzing-driven tain inference):
  If a monitored variable value is tainted while mutate some bytes of the input, that can\
 be infer the variable is depend on the input.( For accurating labor-intensive analysis(V\
Uzzer). Can't cover the case while the variable is implict effec by external syscalls.)
  1.Byte-level mutate
  BLT(S, pos)
  2.Variable value monitoring
  Instrumnet application with special value tracking code. Only track the variable that u\
sed in path constrain.
  3.Taint inference
  testing testcase BLM(S, pos), check if value of variable changes. Infer is var is depen\
d on pos-th byte of input seed S.
  (Specail case: var1=input1; while(var1--){var2++;} if(var2==const){..})
Taint-Guided Mutation:
  Weighted mutate `input byte` position base on taint from FTI. Prioritize some byte of u\
ntouched branches.
  Weight which branch to explore.
Conformance-Guided Evolution
  flip the input to expected value of condition constrain. Collect the code coverage and \
classify by path. If input and branch are higher conformance, prioritize it with higher w\
eight. Seeds with higher conformance are more likely to yield test cases exercising untou\
ched branches. More bit of operands is equal has more conformance.
GreyOne = FTI+TGM+CGE

## Fuzz for deeply nested branches
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12228.pdf
` A branch constraint is the predicate in the conditional statement that guards the branc\
h. The branch is reachable only if (1) the conditional statement is reachable, and (2) th\
e branch constraint is satisfied.`
1: Indentify all condition that target condition depend on( condition use variables which is also used by target condition). Randamly mutate the input for condition constrain that target condition depend on.
2: Choise those input satify those constrain that target condition constrain depend on, mutate to reach target condition constrain( solve the condition constrain that target don't depend on).
3. If 2 can't still reach target condition. Don't mutate the input of 2( indenpent from target). Mutate other input to find a solution satified all condition( Both target depend on and target).

## Learning to Fuzz from Symbolic Execution with Application to Smart Contracts
https://files.sri.inf.ethz.ch/website/papers/ccs19-ilf.pdf
This is fuzzer for smart contract.
1. symbolic excution expert generate test case program.
2. Learn the sequence of testcase, calculate the probability of call using mackov decison\
 process. Imitation learning the expert program, as fuzz policy, fuzz...

## MemFuzz
https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/media/deeds/news/memfuzz-preprint.pdf
Process can't exhibited as control flow behaveior.
Strategy of information-guided fuzzer
InsTrim: edge coverage but not basic blocks. MemFuzz use static analysis tool to instrument memory access.
AFLGo: calculate the distance to the target.
1.Enhance AFL LLVM instrumentation pass. Instrument load and store instruction.
2.Instrument information filtering
  Discard the global variable access and stack variables without using dynameically computed offset.
  Extern AFL runtime library for memory instrument.
  Bloom filter. Deduplicate.
  New edge coverage + new memory addresses were write + new memory address were read.

## Fuzzification anti-fuzzing technoques
1. SpeedBump: amplifies the slowdown in normal executions by hundreds of times to the fuzzed execution. Injects delays to cold path. Randomly CPU-intensive operation and reuse branchtrap for delay. Use CSmith generate code for resistant analysis delay.
cold path: easy to be reached by fuzzing but rarely visited by normal execution. e.g: error handle. Use testcase and inject delays to least-executed cold path.
2. BranchTrap: interfering feedback by hiding paths and polluting coverage maps. Input-sensitive jumps. Any input drift change will change the execution path. Waste the fuzz resources to explore the worthless paths.
Jump map: gadget array. ROP in a jump function. Polluting the coverage information.
3. AntiHybrid: hindering taint-analysis and symbolic execution. Introducing implicit data-flow dependencies, restore the input into a new variable. Replace the comparision operands with hast value.

## FastSyzkaller
Introducing n-Gram to analyse the pattern of crash testcase. Use this information in syzkaller fuzzing.

## FuzzGen
1. Build Abstruct API dependence Graph base on exiting testcase.
2. Generate testcase base on A2DG.
   A2DG:
     1. Control dependence: indicate how the various API calls should be invoked
     2. Data dependence: potential dependence between argument and return value of calls.

# BDA: Practical Dependence Analysis for Binary Executables by Unbiased Whole-Program Path Sampling and Per-Path Abstract Interpretation
https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3360563
### Value Set Analysis( VSA): use interpretation to determine of accessed by memory instructions(possible values for the operands of each instruction).
1. Have subtantial false positices.
2. difficult to scaling to complex binaries.
strided interval: lower bound and upper bound and stride.
possible address from entire memory space lead to bogus dependence.probabilistic guarantees
### Sampling algorithms
### Program Dependexce Analysis: determines if there is dependence between two instructions.
1. Binary program dependence analysis without symbol information, Source level data structures, variables, and arguments are compiled down to registers and memory accesses.
2. indirect control flow.
Dynamic dependence analysis: base on input while symbol execution or fuzz can't generate input well.

## denpendence analysis with probabilistic guarantees, novel randomized abstract interpretation.
1. sample the space of whole program paths without biase of path length.
2. Abstract interpretation
### Alto: Possible Runtime Values: base on base address and offset
### VSA:

## procedure
1. disassemble code from binary
2. Path Sample: static analyze inter-procedural CFG. Path count: more follow path more biase, loop-free, assume call always return back and distribute weight of callee entry block( sum of path), and no indirected call. Assign w0/(w0+w1) to every branch. Weight assign approximation.
3. Abstruact Interpretation: get data flow. Write parttern of memory manager for analysis. Note that in our interpretation, an instruction may be encountered multiple times in a sample path and we distinguish these different instances. In contrast, VSA does not; instead it merges the abstract values for all possible instances, which is an important source of inaccuracy.
4. Posterior Analysis: analyse dependence between memory accessing
